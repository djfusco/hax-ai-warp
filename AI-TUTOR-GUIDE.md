# HAX AI Warp - Context-Aware AI Tutor

## 🎉 **NEW FEATURE: Context-Aware AI Cybersecurity Tutor**

Your HAX AI Warp system now includes an intelligent AI tutor that watches student terminal activity and provides real-time educational guidance!

## 🤖 **How the AI Tutor Works**

### **Automatic Monitoring**
- **Watches every command** students type in the terminal
- **Analyzes output and errors** in real-time
- **Detects patterns** and learning opportunities
- **Provides contextual hints** without being intrusive

### **Smart Assistance**
- **Error Help**: Explains permission denied, command not found, etc.
- **Learning Tips**: Educational insights about cybersecurity tools
- **Next Steps**: Suggests logical progression through exercises  
- **Install Guidance**: Helps with missing tools and software

## 📚 **Example Scenarios**

### **Scenario 1: Permission Denied**
```bash
student@container:~$ nmap 192.168.1.1
nmap: Permission denied
```
**AI Response**: 🔒 Permission Issue Detected
- Network tools like nmap need elevated privileges
- **Try**: `sudo nmap 192.168.1.1`
- **Why**: Network scanning requires root access for security reasons

### **Scenario 2: Successful Scan**
```bash
student@container:~$ nmap 192.168.1.1
22/tcp   open  ssh
80/tcp   open  http
443/tcp  open  https
```
**AI Response**: 🎯 Scan Results Found!
- Great! You found open ports. Here are logical next steps:
- **Try**: `nmap -sV -sC 192.168.1.1` for version detection
- **Why**: Version detection helps identify vulnerabilities

### **Scenario 3: Password Cracking**
```bash
student@container:~$ john hashes.txt
Loaded 5 password hashes
```
**AI Response**: 🔓 Hashes Loaded Successfully
- John the Ripper is ready to crack passwords
- **Try**: `john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hashes.txt`
- **Why**: Dictionary attacks are often more effective than brute force

## 🔧 **Configuration Options**

### **Pattern-Based Mode** (Default)
- Works immediately without any setup
- Uses built-in cybersecurity knowledge
- Provides educational guidance for common scenarios

### **Full AI Mode** (Optional)
- Enhanced with OpenAI GPT integration
