# ðŸ”§ HAX AI Warp - Setup Fixed!

The authentication issue has been resolved. HAX AI Warp now builds the Docker image locally instead of requiring external downloads.

## For Your Friend

### Updated Installation Steps:

```bash
# One command installation:
npx hax-ai-warp
```

### What happens now:
1. âœ… **No authentication required** - Builds locally from Ubuntu 22.04
2. âœ… **Automatic build** - Creates the cybersecurity lab environment 
3. âœ… **First-time setup** - Takes 5-10 minutes to build initially
4. âœ… **Subsequent runs** - Instant startup after first build

### Expected Output:
```
ðŸš€ HAX AI Warp Server running on port 3000
ðŸ“± Interface: http://localhost:3000
Creating session for [user]...
ðŸ”¨ Docker image hax-ai-cyber-lab:latest not found, building...
Building cybersecurity lab Docker image...
[Build progress messages...]
âœ… Docker image hax-ai-cyber-lab:latest already exists
Creating container: hax-[course]-[user]
```

### First Time Build
- **Duration**: 5-10 minutes (one-time only)
- **Downloads**: ~500MB (Ubuntu base image + tools)
- **Storage**: ~1.5GB final image size
- **Progress**: You'll see build messages in the terminal

## Key Changes Made

âœ… **Removed Docker Hub dependency** - No more authentication errors
âœ… **Local build from Dockerfile** - Uses standard Ubuntu 22.04 base
âœ… **Auto-build on demand** - Creates image when first container is needed
âœ… **Same functionality** - All cybersecurity tools and AI features included

## Troubleshooting

### "Unable to find image" Error - FIXED âœ…
This error is now resolved since we build locally.

### Build Issues
If the build fails:
1. Ensure Docker Desktop is running
2. Check you have ~2GB free disk space
3. Verify internet connection (for Ubuntu base image)
4. Try: `docker system prune -f` to clean up space

### Build Progress
Your friend will see:
```
ðŸ”¨ Docker image not found, building...
Building cybersecurity lab Docker image...
Step 1/15 : FROM ubuntu:22.04

Step 2/15 : ENV DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive
